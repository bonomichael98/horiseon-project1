# 01 Assignment

The assignment was provided to me in order to improve the accessability of a webpage and restructure it in a way to make it more easily navigatable, for both users and future modifications. 

## 02 HTML

Changes were made in the HTML file to make the webpage more easy to navigate, as well as updated to make the website show up easier in search engines. 

Semantic tags were added in order to partition key sections and make them more easy to identify. 

Class names were changed to better match CSS elements.

Spacing was changed in order to make text more readable.

## 03 CSS

Changes were made to the CSS that makes it easier to find out what styles are effecting which elements. 

Class selectors names were changed to better match HTML elements. 

Ordering was changed to better match the ordering showed in the HTML file.

Comments were added to better explain changes.

Selectors were consolidated to reduce lines of code.
